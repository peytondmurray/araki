# akari-one

A demo implementation of how akari might be able to work ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Contributing

To build and run the project use `pixi`.

### Build an executable
To just build an executable to run akari-one run
```
$ pixi run build
```
Then, a binary will be available in `./target/akari-one`

### Run with pixi
Or, use pixi to run `cargo run`
```
$ pixi run start -- -h
```

## Try it out

Initialize a project
```
$ akari init myproj
```

Activate that environment
```
$ eval "$(akari activate myproj)"
```

From this point, users can use pixi like they normally would. For example, add python and numpy as a dependency to the project.

```
$ pixi add python=3.13 numpy=2.3
```

Save a checkpoint by running the `tag` command
```
$ akari tag v1 --description "python 3.13 and numpy 2.3"
```

List available tags
```
$ akari list
```

Checkout the latest tag (determined from the git tree) of an environment
```
$ akari checkout latest
```

Deactivate the environment
```
$ eval "$(akari deactivate)"
```

List what other environments are managed by akari by running the `envs` command
```
$ akari envs ls
Available envs:
* myproj
* projmy
```

### Use a remote source
Initialize a project with a remote backend (must use ssh url and have your ssh key loaded into your keychain)
```
$ akari init abc --source git@github.com:soapy1/test-abc.git

```
Push/pull from a remote source
```
$ akari pull

$ akari push v1
```

### Use gitea as a remote source
Provided in this project is a docker compose file that sets up gitea to use a remote source for storing environment definitions. To run gitea, use docker compose

```
$ docker compose up -d
```

##  Next steps
* Rethink how activation/deactivation of environments should work
